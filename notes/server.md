---> create a socket by socket();
---> set up its struct infos ;
---> bind it with a specific ip that part of that struct and a specific port;
---> let the socket in listening mode with a specific num of socket queue to get the incoming connections ;

----> set as operator


(am i should check if that client is registered or not in each command or somewhere else that handle all other commands)
